# How to improve your programming productivity

Hello, my name is Kedzel Mikhail, and this is my guide on how to improve your
productivity while programming
`(first slide)`

Most of you are probably using Windows or Mac OS, some of the more adventurous
folks might be using Linux, but regardless of the operating system you are most 
likey using a *Stacking Window Manager*

`(next slide)`

For the sake of time ill be referring to window manager as wm throughout this talk

`(next slide)`

So, A stacking window manager (also called floating window manager) is a window 
manager that draws all windows in a specific order, allowing them to overlap.
And more often than not you may end up with your desktop looking somehow like
that ![stacking layout example](https://www.linux.org/attachments/kazam_icewm-png.1753/)
Or even like that![even worse stacking layout example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/FLWM_Screenshot.png/1200px-FLWM_Screenshot.png)
As you may've guessed the main downside of such window manages is that it gets
way too crowded way too quickly.You may argue that there are multiple workspaces
in Windows 10 but it doesn't solve the problem completely.

`(next slide)`

And my solution to that are 'Tiling Window Managers'

`(next slide)`

They are the complete opposite of stacking wms as they do not allow overlapping
of windows.Wikipedia says that a tiling window manager is a window manager with
an organization of the screen into mutually non-overlapping frames, as opposed
to the more popular approach of coordinate-based stacking of overlapping objects 
(windows).

`(next slide)`

With a stacking wm your desktop will look similar to that

Or here is my workflow while writing a script for my talk ![Imgur](https://imgur.com/5JC7xXv.png)

`(next slide)`

See how everything is nice, clean and just non-cluttered. I have much more
screen real estate compared to a stacking wm and I can move between windows at
ease with my custom mappings (e.g Alt + H to switch to a window to the right)
on the top I have a live preview of the markdown I am writing, and to the left
I have a browser for finding information on the topic or just imagery for the 
presentation.And of course you can apply everything I said above to your, let's
say, web programming workflow.

`(next slide)`

So how to get into all this stuff

`(next slide)`

First you need a UNIX system, preferably some Linux distribution. My Linux 
distro of choice and a distro I would recommend to anyone starting with Linux
is Manjaro, I have used two distros in the past: Ubuntu which just have too
much stuff built in it by default while Arch Linux which, ironically, has 
pretty much nothing built in it by default and is just too hard to get going 
with.

`(next slide)`

Manjaro is built on top of Arch and has all of its pros while being much
more user friendly.

`(next slide)`

To download manjaro just head to its site (https://manjaro.org/download/) and
download the architect edition, then while installing it , choose i3 as the
window manager.

`(next slide)`

As you may've already noticed there are many different window managers
available, their choice really depends just on your preference. But the most 
popular window manager is i3, as it has pretty good documentation, is quite
user friendly and easy to write config for.

`(next slide)`

Manjaro comes with i3 already configured a bit, so it is easier to get started 
with.When you'll boot Manjaro for the first time and open some programs this 
is what you'll see 
![default manjaro i3 config](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EEV3pSQWwAECeJ1.png)
as opposed to the default config which looks way worse and it less easier to
use ![default i3 config](https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving-1.png).

`(next slide)`

Well the default config is pretty good, but the point of using such window
managers and Linux on the whole is that you can customize it to your desired
needs so open the config file which is located somewhere in ~/i3/.config ,open
the docs and start tinkering!

`(next slide)`

When you've changed all the key mapping you want you've probably noticed that
you can not only customize the bindings but the *look and feel* of your window
manager, this is called *ricing* if you want to see some rices visit unixporn
subreddit - home for NIX customization.

`(next slide)`

Here are some examples of what you can do

`(next slide)`

Or here is how it can look on your monitor
![example 4](https://i.redd.it/8onlcv91d3s31.jpg)
Pretty cool huh? It is pleasing for the eye, efficient to work in and as an
added bonus you'll look like a hacker for everyone looks at your monitor :D

`(next slide)`

Now that you've switched to Linux with a tiling wm its time to start learning 
new things - customize your terminal, use a different shell instead of bash,
switch to vim or emacs as your primary text editor, learn touch typing,
switch to a different keyboard layout and your editing speed and 
productivity will increase massively

`(next slide)`

And let me tell how much fun you'll have learning all those new thing and just
the process of tailoring everything to your needs will be as rewarding and as
satisfying as the end result.

`(next slide)`

Undoubtedly my talk only touched the tip of the iceberg when it comes to NIX
customization, so what are you waiting for? I highly encourage you to go on
and try something new I've mentioned, and even if for some reason you won't
stick with it the learning process itself will make you a better programmer.

Thank you for your attention.
